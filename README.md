- **Reservation System**: Allow customers to make reservations online.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
- **Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard for monitoring restaurant activities.

- **CSS3**: For designing and laying out the interface.
- **JavaScript**: To create functionality and interactivity.
- **Node.js**: For server-side development.
- **Express.js**: For handling server and routes.
- **MongoDB**: As the database for storing restaurant, menu, and user data.
