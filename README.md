## API Usage

This section provides instructions on how to interact with the TopRestaurant API, including setup and usage of the provided Postman collection.

### Setting Up the API

Before you begin, ensure that you have the API running locally or deployed on a server. Follow the installation instructions provided in the previous sections to get the API up and running.

### Importing the Postman Collection

1. Download the `TopTop.json` file from the project repository. This file contains the Postman collection with pre-configured requests for the TopRestaurant API.
2. Open Postman and import the `TopTop.json` file by clicking on `File` > `Import...` and selecting the file from your computer.
3. Once imported, you will see a new collection named `TopRestaurant` in your Postman sidebar, containing various API requests.

### Configuring Environment Variables

The collection uses an environment variable `{{urlV1}}` to dynamically set the API's base URL. To configure this:

1. In Postman, click on the `Environments` tab on the left sidebar.
2. Create a new environment (e.g., `TopRestaurant Local`) and add a variable named `urlV1` with the value set to your API's base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4001/api/v1/` for local development).
3. Select the environment you just created from the dropdown at the top right corner of Postman to activate it.

### Using the API Routes

The API provides several routes for managing restaurants, menus, bookings, and more. Here are some of the key routes:

- **Authentication**: Register, authenticate, and logout users.
- **Restaurants**: Create, update, and retrieve restaurant details.
- **Menus**: Manage restaurant menus and menu items.
- **Bookings**: Handle customer reservations and bookings.
- **Reviews**: Collect and display customer reviews.

Refer to the Postman collection for detailed request examples and parameters for each route.

### Example Requests

- **Register a User**: Select the `Register` request from the collection, modify the request body as needed, and hit send.
- **Create a Booking**: Choose the `Create Booking` request, ensure you're authenticated (use the `Authenticate` request if needed), and customize the request body with your booking details.

For more information on the available routes and their usage, refer to the `api/routes/` directory in the project repository.
